            <p>Hello!</p>

            <p>These days are good. I am stable and relaxed. Letting my brain
            run wild! And the result I am seeing is amazing myself. I am out
            of house more days in past 3 weeks than I have been in past few
                months. I am enjoying learning and building again :)</p>

            <p>Getting back to my github account after 2 years is a sign of
                that! Took me two days to set-up my local repositories for
                building further :D</p>

            <p>Right now I am doing a survey for one of the features that I
                want to build and going through relevant literature and
                documentations. Will post my survey results here next week.
                Will also post here soon what exactly is in my mind. Writing
            my thoughts down at the moment. </p>

            <p>Signing off for the day :)</p>

            <p>Hello! :)</p>

            <p> As you can see, instead of one week from previous post... this
            one is coming after more than a month. And there are very
                valid reasons! I am in recovery and taking my time to find
                what works best, making changes in my lifestyle as needed on
                the way. This month had a few ups and downs but over all okay.</p>

            <p> First the survey! Aim of the survey was to know if generally
                there is an interest in a product where an emergency alert can
                be sent to family/friends/emergency services automatically in
                case an emergency arises. And to learn to create user
                research surveys.
            </p>

            <p> Survey was created using SurveyMonkey and with help from ChatGPT
                and was shared with 100 people from all walks of life using 3
                channels. LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Instagram. 40 people
                responded. Completion rate of the survey is 88%,
                meaning out of all the people who clicked on the survey link
                and landed on the first page actually completed the survey.
            </p>

            <p> I find the results fascinating. Though I have not done the
                scientific statistical analysis here but still the pattern
                seen is interesting. I expected people who have actually
                faced an emergency situation (group 1) would be more interested
                in a product like this than people who know someone with an
                emergency situation (group 2). In the later case, 61%
                respondents said that they are either Definitely or Somewhat
                interested in such a product as compared to 50% respondents
                with an emergency. This rightly may be due to the observation
                that 44% of group 2 respondents had a higher level of concern
                (level 4 & 5) for their own healths as compared to only 38%
                of group 1 respondents with a higher level of concern for their
                health. </p>

            <p> 71% of respondents with level 4 & 5 of concern (high concern
                group) for their own health are either Definitely or Somewhat
                interested in the proposed product. 65% of high concern group
                use a wearable to track their health, 45% have regular doctor
                visits and 45% self-monitor their health. </p>

            <p> More number of women are in this group as compared to other
                genders though 80% of male respondents in high concern group
                own a wearable as compared to 45% of women in the same group.
                To make any remarks about LGBTQIA+ respondents,
                more data is needed.
            </p>

            <p> Based on above observations from the data, a general
                interest is definitely there for an emergency alert product
                which may be integrated profitably with wearables.
            </p>

            <p> I got to learn some important things about discovery surveys for
                product and thanks to my PM course instructor for pointing
                the limitations out for my survey.
                1. Avoid hypothetical questions as people tend to answer ideal
                situations as compared to real ones.
                2. Use less of technical jargon and more of day to day language
                to describe problems and solutions.
                3. Try to find the pain points of the respondents then only a
                proper solution can be found.
            </p>

            <p> Some of the responses by respondents were very insightful
                and took me on a whole tangent of literature research.
                1. "Fall detection" - At the moment the best alert systems
                in the market are for fall detection for the elderly. They
                come in various shapes and sizes and a lot of features.
                2. "Give suggestions for what can be done by the time
                emergency services arrive" - Very important but alas there
                are no viable digital products in this space at the moment
                in the market according to my research and discussion with
                another old colleague on this topic. Emergencies can be
                varied, for physical symptoms, we do have first-aid kits
                but for mental conditions there is nothing. And probably
                this makes a space where efforts need to be put to help all
                of us out.</p>

            <p> As for building the discussed feature in the survey with
                preliminary results <a
                        href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/stories/SM-Feq2UPv_2B4O4QakkXNMj_2Bzg_3D_3D/edit/">
                    here</a>, I am making slow progress. As focusing
                more on few other aspects of my life right now.
            </p>

            <p> Hope to see you all soon! :) </p>
