            <p>Hello!</p>

            <p>These days are good. I am stable and relaxed. Letting my brain
            run wild! And the result I am seeing is amazing myself. I am out
            of house more days in past 3 weeks than I have been in past few
                months. I am enjoying learning and building again :)</p>

            <p>Getting back to my github account after 2 years is a sign of
                that! Took me two days to set-up my local repositories for
                building further :D</p>

            <p>Right now I am doing a survey for one of the features that I
                want to build and going through relevant literature and
                documentations. Will post my survey results here next week.
                Will also post here soon what exactly is in my mind. Writing
            my thoughts down at the moment. </p>

            <p>Signing off for the day :)</p>

            <p>- Akshita</p>
